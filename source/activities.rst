   Countries where the National Society has undertaken activities with drones.


******************
American Red Cross
******************

**Drones used for:** Initial research into drone use, post-disaster situational awareness, mapping.

**Operational examples:** The American Red Cross used drones domestically for the first time during Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in September 2017. Since 2017, the American Red Cross International Services Department GIS/Data Team has used UAS for mapping activities in collaboration with other societies: these mapping projects have taken place in the Philippines, Haiti, and Belize.

**Summary:** In 2014, representatives of the American Red Cross attended the first United Nations Advisory Round Table on humanitarian UAV technology. In April 2015, the American Red Cross and UAS consulting firm Measure released a joint study entitled "Drones for Disaster Response and Relief Operations." The report described potential use cases for the technology, policy recommendations for the development of favorable UAS regulations, and technical information. 

Since 2017, the International Services Department (ISD) GIS/Data Team has used UAS for several mapping activities in their work with other National Societies. At present, however, there is not an overall, organization-wide strategy for integrating UAS into American Red Cross activities domestically. 

In May 2017, the ISD GIS/Data Team used UAS to map 23 barangays in Leyte, Philippines for creation of more detailed OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to be used for disaster management activities. In December 2017, the team used UAS to map 35 sq km of Canaan, Haiti to update the OSM data for the rapidly urbanizing landscape. In January 2019, the team led a community mapping training with Belize Red Cross that included sessions on the use of UAS for mapping.

The first real-world deployment of a drone by the American Red Cross domestically took place in September 2017, as part of the response to Hurricane Harvey in the US state of Texas. In a project funded by the United Parcel Service's charitable wing, Red Cross workers collaborated with drone-makers CyPhy Works to use their tethered UAS to gain situational awareness and capture photographs of hurricane damage.

********************
Australian Red Cross
********************

**Drones used for:**  Initial policy research into drone use.

**Operational examples:** None reported. 

**Summary:** In 2016, the Australian Red Cross, the Australian Government and the International Federation of the Red Cross sponsored drone organization WeRobotics to study the suitability of UAS technology for disaster response operations in the South Pacific. The final report, released in June 2018, noted the importance of "integrating data into decision making processes" and the importance of "evidence-based decision making" when assessing UAV performance: the report also stressed the importance of considering location-specific and contextual factors when considering the use of UAVs in disaster response. 

******************
Austrian Red Cross
******************

**Drones used for:** Search and rescue, situational awareness. 

**Operational examples:** Public demonstrations of UAS capabilities, in collaboration with Austrian K9 search and rescue units. 

**Summary:** The Austrian Red Cross UAS project was initiated in January 2017, after the Austrian Red Cross won a Land Rover competition with a UAV-focused car design. Vehicle and proprietary UK-made drone were delivered soon afterwards under auspices of "Project Hero", launching a still-continuing 2 year experimental phase. The Austrian Red Cross now uses both the Land Rover UAS and multiple other consumer UAS (largely DJI products). The Austrian Red Cross has not yet deployed the UAS in real-world disaster and SAR settings, largely due to a lack of relevant disaster and SAR incidents as well as restrictive Austrian UAS regulations. The ARC has carried out regular trainings and demonstrations with the UAS, and currently have 10 certified drone pilots, as well as a standardized training system. 

************************
Belize Red Cross Society
************************

**Drones used for:** Community mapping efforts, disaster resilience work.

**Operational examples:** Using drones to make maps of multiple communities around Belize City, in support of community mapping efforts for disaster resilience. 

**Summary:** The Belize Red Cross Society uses drones primarily for community mapping exercises and for community disaster resilience preparation In its first operational use of drones, the Belize Red Cross initially planned to use drones to map 16 communities in the vicinity of Belize City. The Red Cross drone pilots worked with other Belizean organizations to conduct mapping exercises, including the Belizean Ministry of Natural Resources, the Lands and Geology Department, and the National Emergency Management Organization. Drone data was used to augment out-of-date Google maps, and to help communities develop disaster risk awareness and planning strategies, giving them a "big picture" view of their homes.  The Belize Red Cross hopes that communities will use these maps and the training provided to them as a means of developing "sustainable" disaster response systems and strategies: they also hope that the UAS-created maps will be shared throughout the Belize emergency management community when the next disaster hits.

**********************

**Drones used for:** Damage-assessment mapping, post-disaster photography and video.

**Operational examples:** Pacific Flying Labs, in coordination with the Fiji Red Cross Society, attempted to use a Phantom 4 Professional drone to document damage from Tropical Cyclone Keni in the Kadavu Region in April 2018. Ultimately, high winds prevented the drone from being flown safely in the area. 

**Summary:** Tropical Cyclone Keni hit Fiji on April 10th 2018, causing widespread damage across the island. The Fiji Red Cross Society and Pacific Flying Labs worked together to collect images of the village of Manuana, combining on-foot surveys and aerial mapping techniques. 

****************
German Red Cross
****************

**Drones used for:** Search and rescue, situational awareness.  

**Operational examples:** The German Red Cross Kreisverband Limburg (a district association of the German Red Cross) has used its DJI Matrice 200 drone during four SAR operations  at the time of writing. On one occasion, the drone was used to search for signs of a sinkhole in an area where an explosion attributed to unexploded ordnance took place. The drone was used to look at the area to evaluate risk to fire teams. On a second occasion, the drone was used to assess an ongoing 11 acre-wide fire in a national park area. Additionally, the drone was used to assist with searching for missing people on two different occasions. 

**Summary:** The German Red Cross Kreisverband Limburg is actively experimenting with UAS technology at this time to support SAR operations with dogs, facilitate fire department situational awareness, create maps of disaster areas, and to provide lighting for search teams on dark nights. The organization hopes to use UAS equipped with thermal sensors to enhance visual searches for missing people. Additionally, the organization is  working with UgCS specialized software for drone search and rescue operations, which facilitates extensive, comprehensive searches using drones over wide areas.

****************************
Indonesian Red Cross Society
****************************

**Drones used for:** Disaster resilience mapping, IDP camp planning, vulnerability and capacity assessment support. 

**Operational examples:** The Indonesian Red Cross Society (Palang Merah Indonesia - PMI) has used its DJI Phantom 4 Professional drone on a number of real-world missions. These include mapping a displaced person's camp in Sulawesi, creating orthomosaic maps of Malaku, supporting earthquake readiness projects in Java, and more. 

**Summary:** The Indonesian Red Cross (PMI) acquired its first drone in early 2017, hoping to use it to create high-quality and up-to-date photographic maps, or orthomosaics. The organization has since flown its DJI Phantom 4 Professional drone throughout the country, largely in support of disaster risk resilience (DRR) and Vulnerability and Capacity Assessment (VCA) activities. The high-quality drone imagery they collect helps PMI and community leaders to better identify potential disaster risks and dangers before they take place. 

PMI uses open platforms OpenStreetMap (OSM) and OpenAerialMap (OAM) to create community maps and to ensure that the drone data they collect is available for public use.  Its first project used drones to create orthomosaic maps of areas of the island of Malaku for disaster risk reduction purposes: these maps were uploaded to OpenAerialMap and used for OpenStreetMap mapping activities.  Drone imagery enables PMI to help communities create better, more up-to-date and accurate maps than they might otherwise have access to, giving them a more accurate "big picture" view of their communities and the potential disaster risks they face.

***********************************************
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
***********************************************

**Drones used for:** Mapping, infrastructure planning. 

**Operational examples:** None at this time. 

**Summary:** The ICRC has developed a number of policy documents related to drone technology in recent years. The 2017 ICRC Data Protection Handbook included specific guidance related to the ethical use of drone data.  In 2019 in Mozambique, the ICRC conducted limited, non-operational testing of drone technology. The ICRC plans to conduct proof-of-concept drone technology tests in 2020. One such test is planned in Juba, South Sudan: drones will be used to map and plan water infrastructure. The ICRC hopes to build a small air operations team: from there, it hopes to train "all the units to have their own pilot certified by Air Operations." 

Eventually, the ICRC may operate regional drone "hubs" which will enable units to quickly access drone technology when they need it, without requiring that they purchase a drone themselves.  The ICRC is also interested in potentially working with outside partners to collect drone data, such as Flying Labs. In its experiments going forward, the ICRC will be emphasizing data security and data protection, and will pay special attention to how it might ethically operate UAS in conflict areas and in complex emergencies.

*****************
Italian Red Cross
*****************

**Drones used for:** Search and rescue.

**Operational examples:** 2015 experimental joint exercise in Turin area. 

**Summary:** Desk research indicates that the Italian Red Cross used a drone with Red Cross insignia on it in 2015.  This appears to be linked to a November 2015 joint exercise between the Italian Red Cross and the Politecnico of Turin, in which medical teams and engineers used a thermal-camera equipped drone to assist with a simulated search and rescue operation. In 2016, the Italian Red Cross in Bologna announced a collaboration with the UK-based telematics provider Octo on a "drone intelligence service" for emergency rescue operations. We were unable to contact a representative of the organization for an informational interview for this project. 

***********************
Kenya Red Cross Society
***********************

**Drones used for:** Mapping, agricultural monitoring, risk mapping, disaster response. 

**Operational examples:** Recent Kenyan Red Cross drone missions (with mentorship from Canadian companies DAC and Altohelix) include: creating drone maps of the Dadab refugee camp, documenting shelter reconstruction efforts and crop health monitoring in Kilifi, flood response and documentation in Moyale, flood search and resuce in West Pokot, and  flood risk mapping in Narok County.

**Summary:** In June 2017, the Kenyan Red Cross used drone footage provided by the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre to convey the scale of flooding in the Ewaso Ngiro river basin. The Kenyan Red Cross began its own drone program in early 2019, working closely with Canada-based companies DAC Aviation and Altohelix. The drone program's goal is to build in-house drone-piloting and drone data-analysis capacity amongst Kenyan Red Cross staff both at headquarters and amongst regional teams. Ultimately, it hopes to be able to provide drone services to the broader humanitarian community, including UNHCR: it also hopes to work with drone-delivery technology (dependent upon the loosening of Kenya's current, strict, drone regulations). Currently, the program works with 2 drone models: the DJI Mavic 2 Enterprise and the Mavic Pro 2, as well as the ArcGIS, Pix4D, and OpenDroneMap software packages.

Spanish Red Cross
*****************

**Drones used for:** Search and rescue, situational awareness, mapping. 

**Operational examples:** In October 2017, the Spanish Red Cross used drones in a search and rescue pilot project at a beach in Tenerife. This initial pilot project has been followed by a number of other search and rescue pilots in different environments, including lakes, mountains, and more sea rescues. Some Spanish Red Cross branches currently use drones to record simulated emergency exercises.

In 2018, during the response to the Indonesian earthquakes, the Spanish Red Cross deployed an information management field assessment coordination team (IM FACT) to map IDP camps in Sulawesi: the Spanish Red Cross worked with teams from the Indonesian Red Cross Society and the IFRC to use a Phantom 4 Pro drone to collect map data.

**Summary:** The Spanish Red Cross first used drones in October 2017, as part of a search and rescue pilot project: the drone was used to deliver a RFD (rescue floatability device) to a distressed person in the ocean. In June 2018, the Spanish Red Cross created a working group to "assess [the technology], define the drone requirements, and create procedures." In 2018, the Spanish Red Cross was involved with drone mapping efforts at IDP camps in Sulawesi, as part of the response to the Indonesian earthquakes. Currently, the working group consists of 4 volunteer drone pilots and 3 disaster management officers. As of this writing, the Spanish Red Cross has carried out multiple pilot projects involving drones, primarily using the aircraft to assist in search and rescue operations. The SPRC is involved in a 5G pilot project with assistance from Vodafone and Altran: search and rescue teams are testing an app that enables their drones to more effectively stream video, night video, and thermal imagery.
