Specific search terms were used to identify press releases, reports, and other sources describing RCRC drone uses. Various networks such as Surge Information Management Support (SIMS) were queried about any knowledge of drone uses. Identified National Society staff and volunteers were asked about any drone use cases that they were themselves aware of.  

We conducted a total of 17 written and telephone interviews with RCRC or ICRC staff and volunteers. After we confirmed that drones had been used by a National Society in some capacity, we attempted to reach out to representatives of that National Society to identify the individuals who had piloted or otherwise worked closely with the technology. With the consent of the interviewee, all interviews were recorded. 

RCRC drone uses were sorted and categorized using a data extraction tool, drawing from both desk research and interview data. Variables of interest included what purpose the drones were used for, what type of drone was used, what type of software was used, reported technical challenges, and reported regulatory challenges, among others. We identified overarching or repeating themes and issues using this data extraction tool.

We apologize for any usage or events we missed in our research. We would like to hear from you so that we can then include your experience with drone technology in future research and written reports. Please contact daniel.joseph@redcross.org regarding any omissions.
