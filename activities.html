<p><strong>Drones used for:</strong> Initial research into drone use, post-disaster situational awareness, mapping.</p>
<p><strong>Operational examples:</strong> The American Red Cross used drones domestically for the first time during Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in September 2017. Since 2017, the American Red Cross International Services Department GIS/Data Team has used UAS for mapping activities in collaboration with other societies: these mapping projects have taken place in the Philippines, Haiti, and Belize.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> In 2014, representatives of the American Red Cross attended the first United Nations Advisory Round Table on humanitarian UAV technology. In April 2015, the American Red Cross and UAS consulting firm Measure released a joint study entitled “Drones for Disaster Response and Relief Operations.” The report described potential use cases for the technology, policy recommendations for the development of favorable UAS regulations, and technical information. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id24" id="id1">1</a></p>
<p>Since 2017, the International Services Department (ISD) GIS/Data Team has used UAS for several mapping activities in their work with other National Societies. At present, however, there is not an overall, organization-wide strategy for integrating UAS into American Red Cross activities domestically.</p>
<p>In May 2017, the ISD GIS/Data Team used UAS to map 23 barangays in Leyte, Philippines for creation of more detailed OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to be used for disaster management activities. In December 2017, the team used UAS to map 35 sq km of Canaan, Haiti to update the OSM data for the rapidly urbanizing landscape. In January 2019, the team led a community mapping training with Belize Red Cross that included sessions on the use of UAS for mapping.</p>
<p>The first real-world deployment of a drone by the American Red Cross domestically took place in September 2017, as part of the response to Hurricane Harvey in the US state of Texas. In a project funded by the United Parcel Service’s charitable wing, Red Cross workers collaborated with drone-makers CyPhy Works to use their tethered UAS to gain situational awareness and capture photographs of hurricane damage.</p>

<p><strong>Drones used for:</strong>  Initial policy research into drone use.</p>
<p><strong>Operational examples:</strong> None reported.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> In 2016, the Australian Red Cross, the Australian Government and the International Federation of the Red Cross sponsored drone organization WeRobotics to study the suitability of UAS technology for disaster response operations in the South Pacific. The final report, released in June 2018, noted the importance of “integrating data into decision making processes” and the importance of “evidence-based decision making” when assessing UAV performance: the report also stressed the importance of considering location-specific and contextual factors when considering the use of UAVs in disaster response.</p>

<p><strong>Drones used for:</strong> Search and rescue, situational awareness.</p>
<p><strong>Operational examples:</strong> Public demonstrations of UAS capabilities, in collaboration with Austrian K9 search and rescue units.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Austrian Red Cross UAS project was initiated in January 2017, after the Austrian Red Cross won a Land Rover competition with a UAV-focused car design. Vehicle and proprietary UK-made drone were delivered soon afterwards under auspices of “Project Hero”, launching a still-continuing 2 year experimental phase. The Austrian Red Cross now uses both the Land Rover UAS and multiple other consumer UAS (largely DJI products). The Austrian Red Cross has not yet deployed the UAS in real-world disaster and SAR settings, largely due to a lack of relevant disaster and SAR incidents as well as restrictive Austrian UAS regulations. The ARC has carried out regular trainings and demonstrations with the UAS, and currently have 10 certified drone pilots, as well as a standardized training system.</p>

<h2>Belize Red Cross Society<a class="headerlink" href="#belize-red-cross-society" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>Drones used for:</strong> Community mapping efforts, disaster resilience work.</p>
<p><strong>Operational examples:</strong> Using drones to make maps of multiple communities around Belize City, in support of community mapping efforts for disaster resilience.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Belize Red Cross Society uses drones primarily for community mapping exercises and for community disaster resilience preparation In its first operational use of drones, the Belize Red Cross initially planned to use drones to map 16 communities in the vicinity of Belize City. The Red Cross drone pilots worked with other Belizean organizations to conduct mapping exercises, including the Belizean Ministry of Natural Resources, the Lands and Geology Department, and the National Emergency Management Organization. Drone data was used to augment out-of-date Google maps, and to help communities develop disaster risk awareness and planning strategies, giving them a “big picture” view of their homes.  The Belize Red Cross hopes that communities will use these maps and the training provided to them as a means of developing “sustainable” disaster response systems and strategies: they also hope that the UAS-created maps will be shared throughout the Belize emergency management community when the next disaster hits.</p>

<p><strong>Drones used for:</strong> Post-disaster mapping, search and rescue.</p>
<p><strong>Operational examples:</strong> Mapping for emergency response operations after the Mocoa landslide in 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Colombian Red Cross Society began integrating drones into their operations in 2016. Initially it was thought to use drones to support search and rescue activities. The National Society has leveraged staff and volunteers who have been trained and certified personally and voluntarily by their own means. In 2017, drones were used in support of emergency response operations after the Mocoa landslide by mapping the area, helping to assess the magnitude of the tragedy and allowing a contextual analysis to ensure staff safety. In 2018, the Colombian Red Cross team participated in a drone training coordinated by WFP. In 2020, the Cundinamarca Branch plans to participate in a training that focuses on the use of drones for risk management, emergency response, and search and rescue operations.</p>

<p><strong>Drones used for:</strong> Search and rescue, situational awareness.</p>
<p><strong>Operational examples:</strong> The German Red Cross Kreisverband Limburg (a district association of the German Red Cross) has used its DJI Matrice 200 drone during four SAR operations  at the time of writing. On one occasion, the drone was used to search for signs of a sinkhole in an area where an explosion attributed to unexploded ordnance took place. The drone was used to look at the area to evaluate risk to fire teams. On a second occasion, the drone was used to assess an ongoing 11 acre-wide fire in a national park area. Additionally, the drone was used to assist with searching for missing people on two different occasions.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The German Red Cross Kreisverband Limburg is actively experimenting with UAS technology at this time to support SAR operations with dogs, facilitate fire department situational awareness, create maps of disaster areas, and to provide lighting for search teams on dark nights. The organization hopes to use UAS equipped with thermal sensors to enhance visual searches for missing people. Additionally, the organization is  working with UgCS specialized software for drone search and rescue operations, which facilitates extensive, comprehensive searches using drones over wide areas. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id27" id="id4">4</a></p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Indonesian Red Cross (PMI) acquired its first drone in early 2017, hoping to use it to create high-quality and up-to-date photographic maps, or orthomosaics. The organization has since flown its DJI Phantom 4 Professional drone throughout the country, largely in support of disaster risk resilience (DRR) and Vulnerability and Capacity Assessment (VCA) activities. The high-quality drone imagery they collect helps PMI and community leaders to better identify potential disaster risks and dangers before they take place.</p>
<p>PMI uses open platforms OpenStreetMap (OSM) and OpenAerialMap (OAM) to create community maps and to ensure that the drone data they collect is available for public use.  Its first project used drones to create orthomosaic maps of areas of the island of Malaku for disaster risk reduction purposes: these maps were uploaded to OpenAerialMap and used for OpenStreetMap mapping activities.  Drone imagery enables PMI to help communities create better, more up-to-date and accurate maps than they might otherwise have access to, giving them a more accurate “big picture” view of their communities and the potential disaster risks they face.</p>

<p><strong>Drones used for:</strong> Mapping, infrastructure planning.</p>
<p><strong>Operational examples:</strong> None at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The ICRC has developed a number of policy documents related to drone technology in recent years. The 2017 ICRC Data Protection Handbook included specific guidance related to the ethical use of drone data.  In 2019 in Mozambique, the ICRC conducted limited, non-operational testing of drone technology. The ICRC plans to conduct proof-of-concept drone technology tests in 2020. One such test is planned in Juba, South Sudan: drones will be used to map and plan water infrastructure. The ICRC hopes to build a small air operations team: from there, it hopes to train “all the units to have their own pilot certified by Air Operations.”</p>
<p>Eventually, the ICRC may operate regional drone “hubs” which will enable units to quickly access drone technology when they need it, without requiring that they purchase a drone themselves.  The ICRC is also interested in potentially working with outside partners to collect drone data, such as Flying Labs. In its experiments going forward, the ICRC will be emphasizing data security and data protection, and will pay special attention to how it might ethically operate UAS in conflict areas and in complex emergencies.</p>

<p><strong>Operational examples:</strong> In October 2017, the Spanish Red Cross used drones in a search and rescue pilot project at a beach in Tenerife. This initial pilot project has been followed by a number of other search and rescue pilots in different environments, including lakes, mountains, and more sea rescues. Some Spanish Red Cross branches currently use drones to record simulated emergency exercises.</p>
<p>In 2018, during the response to the Indonesian earthquakes, the Spanish Red Cross deployed an information management field assessment coordination team (IM FACT) to map IDP camps in Sulawesi: the Spanish Red Cross worked with teams from the Indonesian Red Cross Society and the IFRC to use a Phantom 4 Pro drone to collect map data.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Spanish Red Cross first used drones in October 2017, as part of a search and rescue pilot project: the drone was used to deliver a RFD (rescue floatability device) to a distressed person in the ocean. In June 2018, the Spanish Red Cross created a working group to “assess [the technology], define the drone requirements, and create procedures.” In 2018, the Spanish Red Cross was involved with drone mapping efforts at IDP camps in Sulawesi, as part of the response to the Indonesian earthquakes. Currently, the working group consists of 4 volunteer drone pilots and 3 disaster management officers. As of this writing, the Spanish Red Cross has carried out multiple pilot projects involving drones, primarily using the aircraft to assist in search and rescue operations. The SPRC is involved in a 5G pilot project with assistance from Vodafone and Altran: search and rescue teams are testing an app that enables their drones to more effectively stream video, night video, and thermal imagery.</p>
